# WeatherApp

There are Some Points Which i would like to add as a part of Good to have Feature.

1. We can have a search location feature by which the user can search for any of the place and based on the Lat Long we can location.
2. We can add some UI Animations Like, based on Kind of weather the Home Screen Tile Background can be changed based on the weather.
3. Themes can be added based on the time in the location.

I have added Test Case where we can mock the response and make sure that the response we are receiving is properly in line with our data sets and app where ever the data is used.
